## What We Do

We Build **Data Products**

* Dashboards / web applications
* API services
* *Productionized* Machine Learning

## Dashboards / Web Applications {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental}
- Underestimated communication tool
- Time-savings for analysts
- Reinforces importance of data quality

## API Services {transition="slide-in none-out"}

Customer-facing or internal facing

::: {.notes}
- Google is a great example of this, their Maps API is used by many (including Ketchbrook) for geo-coding w/ Market Magnify
- We have a client who is a target marketing firm, and they get a ton of customer account data from their bank clients each month. This enables them to do some benchmarking (e.g., this person with an account at your bank is in the top 13% of all customers in the U.S. in terms of their savings account balance)
- Here's an example from one of our clients who provides a benchmarking API service that we helped build out for banks to consume within their CRM platform

## Machine Learning {transition="none-out"}

Data enables the *possibility* of ML

**Example ML use cases**: 

- Automated Lending
- Target Marketing
- Customer Churn
- Insurance Pricing

::: {.notes}
- Just because we have data in a database somewhere, doesn't automatically mean that we can start doing machine learning -- it needs to start with a use case, and then we either have the data available to solve that business problem with ML, or we need to go and get it
- Some example use cases include:
  + automated lending
  + target marketing
  + customer churn
  + insurance pricing

## Machine Learning {transition="none-in"}

<img src="www/model_as_api.png">

::: {.notes}
When we think of productionizing machine learning we really think about doing that two ways:
  - wrapping up the model inside a REST API so that it can be used for on-demand predictions
- So let's use the automated lending example [walk through diagram]

What does it mean for you?

::: {.notes}
- There was a time, when to find the answer to a question you had to open up an encyclopedia, go to a library, or call someone who you thought might know the answer
- Now, most of the world's information has been posted on the internet
- And Google has done this *incredible* job of finding & ranking the information that best answers the question you typed into this single little text box
  + It has to be the biggest dichotomy between the complexity of what's on the screen versus the power behind that single text box you type into 
- There used to be a show on TV called "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", and if you didn't know the answer to a question you could "phone a friend"; there's know way this exists anymore since I imagine people getting that call could just pull out their phone and type it into Google
- In my opinion, it's just a better version of Google -- which everyone uses to answer just about everything they do nowadays -- you're going to get your information sooner, and you'll have to do *less* work potentially than you would searching Google and collating results into a single paper/deliverable

## Advice

- Learn a little bit of programming in R or Python (I think R is easier to get started with)
- Programming is *so* much more approachable than it used to be
- If you can write a formula in Excel, you can program
- HOWEVER -- *How* you are taught is critical (make it use-case driven, and learn the fundamentals along the way, not all up front)
- Find something you like to ~~do~~ learn about
